# Welcome to the future

This is a native application running in your browser.
Powered by Rust and WebAssembly.

### Inspiration

After watching these 2 videos:

* [Web-Native Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y10jJX35shE&t=441s)
* [Ascii Image Converter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSYd8HjY6GE)

I decided to combine them and created this app.

### Run locally (native native) 

`cargo run`

### Run locally (browser native) 

`cargo install --locked trunk && trunk serve`

### Run from static site hosting

[from Github](github.io/maixnor/ascii)
